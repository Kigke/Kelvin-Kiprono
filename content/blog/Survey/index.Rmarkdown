Simple Linear Regression: Involves one independent variable and one dependent variable, modeled as:

𝑦=𝛽0 +𝛽1𝑥+𝜖

where :
- y is the dependent variable, 

- x is the independent variable, 

- 𝛽0 is the intercept, 

- β 1 is the slope, and 

- ϵ is the error term.

## Assumptions

- Linearity: The relationship between the dependent and independent variables should be linear.
- Independence: Observations should be independent of each other.
- Homoscedasticity: The variance of error terms should be constant across all levels of the - independent variable.
- Normality: The residuals (errors) should be normally distributed.
