title: "Hypothesis Testing"
subtitle: ""
excerpt: "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine if there is enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis (H0) in favor of an alternative hypothesis (𝐻𝑎 ). By analyzing sample data, the process involves setting a significance level, calculating a test statistic, and comparing it to a critical value or P-value to make data-driven decisions. Common tests include t-tests, z-tests, and chi-square tests, applied in diverse fields to validate assumptions and drive conclusions."

## T-TEST 

The t tests are based on an assumption that data come from the normal distribution. In the one-sample case we thus have data x1, . . . , xn assumed to be independent realizations of random variables with distribution N(µ, σ2), which denotes the normal distribution with mean µ and variance σ2, and we wish to test the null hypothesis that µ = µ0. We canestimate the parameters µ and σ by the empirical mean x¯ and standard deviations, although we must realize that we could never pinpoint their values exactly.

Here is an example concerning daily energy intake in kJ for 11 women

```{r}
daily.intake <- c(5260,5470,5640,6180,6390,6515,
+ 6805,7515,7515,8230,8770)
```
Let us first look at some simple summary statistics, even though these are hardly necessary for such a small data set

```{r}
mean(daily.intake)
```
```{r}
sd(daily.intake)
```
```{r}
quantile(daily.intake)
```
You might wish to investigate whether the women’s energy intake deviates systematically from a recommended value of 7725 kJ. Assuming that data come from a normal distribution, the object is to test whether this
distribution might have mean µ = 7725. This is done with t.test as follows
```{r}
t.test(daily.intake,mu=7725)
```
You can immediately see that p < 0.05 and thus that (using the customary 5% level of significance) data deviate significantly from the hypothesis that the mean is 7725.

**alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 7725**

This contains two important pieces of information:
 - (a) the value wewanted to test whether the mean could be equal to (7725 kJ) 
 - (b) that the test is two-sided (“not equal to”)
 
 **95 percent confidence interval:**
**5986.348 7520.925**

This is a 95% confidence interval for the true mean; that is, the set of (hypothetical) mean values from which the data do not deviate significantly.
It is based on inverting the t test by solving for the values of µ0 that cause t to lie within its acceptance region.

The function t.test has a number of optional arguments, three of which are relevant in one-sample problems. We have already seen the use of mu to specify the mean value µ under the null hypothesis (default is mu=0). In
addition, you can specify that a one-sided test is desired against alternatives greater than µ by using alternative="greater" or alternatives less than µ using alternative="less". The third item that can be specified is the confidence level used for the confidence intervals; you would write conf.level=0.99 to get a 99% interval.
