**Tidyverse** is a collection of R packages designed for data science, providing tools for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. It includes packages like ggplot2 (for plotting), dplyr (for data manipulation), tidyr (for reshaping data), and more, all built around a consistent design philosophy.

**dplyr** is a package within the tidyverse focused specifically on data manipulation. It provides a set of intuitive functions like filter(), select(), mutate(), summarize(), and arrange() to perform operations such as filtering, selecting, transforming, summarizing, and sorting data in a straightforward and readable way.
